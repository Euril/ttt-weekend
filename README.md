# Tic-Tac-Toe ï¼ƒ

### Game
**Tic Tac Toe** is a two-player game in which the objective is to take turns and mark the correct spaces in a 3x3 (or larger) grid. Think on your feet but also be careful, as the first player who places three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row wins the game!

### Comments
I tried to go for a nixie-tube kind of style, took some time to get the glow effect hope you like. In the css (line 26 & 68) you can remove the comments on the animation to have a cool glint of neon action going on, had to comment it out because made browser very laggy.
